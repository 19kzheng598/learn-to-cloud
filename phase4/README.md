# Phase 4: DevOps fundamentals

## How does this phase apply to Cloud?

DevOps is all about getting your solutions to run efficiently. It's not specific to Cloud, as you can implement DevOps practices on-prem as well.

Read up on what DevOps is. Each cloud platform has a suite of DevOps tools, I've linked a few articles here:

- [Microsoft - What is DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/overview/what-is-devops/#overview)
- [AWS - What is DevOps](https://aws.amazon.com/devops/what-is-devops/)
- [IBM - A DevOps complete guide](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/devops-a-complete-guide)

I also think it's worth reading [The Phoenix Project](https://itrevolution.com/the-phoenix-project/) it's a pretty fun read because it's a fictional story but it explains the importance of DevOps. But if you'd prefer something more like a textbook with similar ideas, check out [The DevOps Handbook](https://itrevolution.com/the-devops-handbook/).

## How to break down this phase

I would suggest spending time on these topics and this timeline:

| Order | Topic                 | Time commitment |
|-------|-----------------------|-------------------|
| 1 | CI/CD with GitHub Actions | 2 weeks 
| 2 | IaC with Terraform | 2 weeks          |
| 3 | Monitoring with Prometheus | 2 weeks     |
| 4 | Containers with Docker | 1 week          |
| 5 | Containers orchestration with Kubernetes | 1 week          |

Of course feel free to spend as much time as you'd like, people have asked for a timeline and breakdown so I've added it. Every DevOps practice matters, but these are the most used on an entry/junior level. You should already be familiar with Version Control from Phase 2.

## Things you should be familiar with at the end of this phase

- Working knowledge of at least one continuous integration tool (Github Actions, Jenkins, etc)
- An understanding of infrastructure as code (why you'd use it, etc). 
- An understanding of containerization (why/when you'd need it / use containers)
- An understanding of the practice of Continuous Integration (why it's needed) and have at least one project in your github deployed with a pipeline.
- An appreciation for the ideas behind: "immutable infrastructure"
- An appreciation for monitoring and the basic ideas of logs, metrics, traces
- An appreciation for "declarative and imperative infrastructure as code"
- Be able to explain each DevOps practice
    - What each one accomplishes
    - Why each one matters
- Hands on experience with
    - CI/CD
    - IaC
