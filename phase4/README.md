# Phase 4: DevOps fundamentals

## How does this phase apply to Cloud?

DevOps is all about getting your solutions to run efficiently. It's not specific to Cloud, as you can implement DevOps practices on-prem too.

First off, read some stuff about what DevOps is. Each cloud platform has a suite of DevOps tools, I've linked a few articles here.

- [Microsoft - What is DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/overview/what-is-devops/#overview)
- [AWS - What is DevOps](https://aws.amazon.com/devops/what-is-devops/)
- [IBM - A DevOps complete guide](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/devops-a-complete-guide)

I also think it's worth reading [The Phoenix Project](https://itrevolution.com/the-phoenix-project/) it's a pretty fun read because it's a fictional story but it explains the importance of DevOps. But if you'd prefer something more like a textbook with similiar ideas, check out [The DevOps Handbook](https://itrevolution.com/the-devops-handbook/).

## DevOps practices

- Continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD)
- Version Control
- Infrastructure as Code
- Configuration management
- Monitoring (logs, metrics, traces)

You might be thinking that 4 weeks isn't a lot of time to cover all these, and you're right. With DevOps, it's so hard to establish a standard of learning, because every organization implements it differently. However, I think if you spent these 4 weeks learning Version control, CI/CD and Infrastructure as Code, you'll have  good foundation. You'll also be exposed to these practices in the resume projects I listed in the cloud projects table.

## Projects

| Title                                                        | Resource                                                                          |
| :----------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Deploy a VNet (or VPC) and 2 VMs in the cloud with Terraform | Make sure you can SSH into both VMs and from vm1 you can ping vm2 and vice-versa. |
| Remember that NAS project from Phase 1?                      | Deploy it with Terraform                                                          |
| Remember nextcloud project from Phase 1?                     | [Deploy it with  Terraform to an ec2 instance with github actions](https://github.com/abdrrahimelh/terraform-nextcloud)


## Things you should be familiar with at the end of this phase

- Working knowledge of at least one continuous integration tool (Github Actions, Jenkins, etc)
- An understanding of infrastructure as code (why you'd use it, etc). 
- An understanding of containerization (why/when you'd need it / use containers)
- An understanding of the practice of Continuous Integration (why it's needed) and have at least one project in your github deployed with a pipeline.
- An appreciation for the ideas behind: "immutable infrastructure"
- An appreciation for monitoring and the basic ideas of logs, metrics, traces
- An appreciation for "declarative and imperative infrastructure as code"
