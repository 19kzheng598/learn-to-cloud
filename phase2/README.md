# Phase 2: Programming fundamentals

## How does this phase apply to Cloud?

You'll be using code to automate tasks and deploy infrastructure. You don't need to know how to build full applications but understanding the basics of programming will give you an upper hand.

There are dedicated developer roles in cloud. For those you will need to know how to build full solutions, checkout [this video](https://youtu.be/WMUAc7bvB7M) for more info on that role. 

In the previous step you were introduced and wrote some Bash scripts. Bash scripting is used to automate tasks and is considered a universal language for servers, since nowadays, Bash is installed by default almost on every Linux server.

I think now it would be beneficial to learn some more programming skills.

For this, I would go with [Python](https://www.python.org/). It's a very popular language and there are many quality free resources out there to learn it and it's one of the simpler languages to get started with.

Take some time now to create a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account if you don't already have one. It'll be your code portfolio and you should put as many projects as you'd like on there.

You can follow any one of the python resources, you don't have to do them all, but definitely pair it with a Git one. [Git](https://git-scm.com/) is the most popular version control tool and one of the DevOps practices.

As you work through these resources, make sure to create the project and demos they show on your own machine and even push them to your GitHub profile. Just make sure to use a [README](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-on-github/about-readmes) to document your project.

 There are plenty of lists of projects out there you can do. Google is your best bet here.

## Things you should be familiar with at the end of this phase

- Variables
- Functions (defining them, function arguments)
- When and how to use arrays, lists, dictionaries.
- Basic data types and their uses (strings, booleans etc)
- Iteration (for loops, etc)
- An understanding of why testing your code is and it's importance (try to implement a simple unit test with a project you do)
- Classes and OOP concepts.

## Certifications you might want to look into

- [Python Institute certifications](https://pythoninstitute.org/certification/)

Programming certifications aren't as in demand/popular than cloud ones. As with any certification, you can use it to reinforce your knowledge, but it isn't an obligation. There are plenty of cloud engineers with zero certifications.
