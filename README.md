## What is Learn to Cloud?

This is a guide based on our experiences getting into Cloud and DevOps. It's not a book or course. It outlines everything you need to learn so that at the end of it you should have the technical knowledge for roles like:

- System administrator.
- Cloud Support Engineer.
- Cloud Administrator.

## Who are the authors?

- Hi, [I'm Gwyn](https://aka.ms/madebygps), the original author of Learn to Cloud and it all started from [this tweet](https://twitter.com/madebygps/status/1406258053427740672?lang=en). 

You can learn more about our journeys into cloud here:

We tried to keep it as general and using the most popular options (in terms of content, community, and jobs) as possible. The 6 month timeline is something we put in place to help people with planning and accountability. It may take you more or less time for each phase and if it does, that is completely fine.
